\section{Can I Rely On You - appendix}\label{appendix:can-i-rely}

\subsection*{Attribution Examples}\label{appendix:attribution-examples}

Because the amount of attribution examples is to large to fit them in the appendix, they are available at \url{https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/177nMz2Y21Z505Eb5r8NZwAMQoMfX6S5f?usp=sharing} (total number of files equals $23150$). File structure is following the pattern \verb|{{Dataset}/{Model version}/{XAI method}|. Each image has a filename containing:

\verb|{index}-{true class}-{predicted class}.png|

\subsection{Infidelity - combined scores}\label{appendix:combined-inf}

Individual scores can be find at \url{https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_0PaXj2QbuW5DyAFjlrKAUjJ_iaoEn9a?usp=sharing}. Folder "\textbf{individual}" contains separated scores per dataset/model. Folder "\textbf{combined}" contains combined scores. Folder "\textbf{confidence}" contains infidelity values with standard deviation values.

All scores are the mean value for the particular model and are related to that models' predicted scores (x-axis). Each data point is a mean value of the same amount of samples per dataset. Amounts differ between datasets to always split the results into 30 equally-sized bins.}\label{fig:efficientnet-inf-std}

\subsection{Sensitivity - combined scores}\label{appendix:combined-sens}

Individual scores can be find at \url{https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/12eYJSZFMfI2FZhXQSuwJQ6I8w65EU25e?usp=sharing}. Folder "\textbf{individual}" contains separated scores per dataset/model. Folder "\textbf{combined}" contains combined scores. Folder "\textbf{confidence}" contains sensitivity values with standard deviation values.
